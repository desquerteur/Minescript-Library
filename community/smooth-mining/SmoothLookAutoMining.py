# Macro decided to automate mining with a smooth loo, meaning it will smoothly go to blocks. 
# Cluster detection by default on, meaning it looks at clustered blocks first(toggleable from that to distance based)
# Code is not made for any server, instead singleplayer. Meaning it does not have failsafes against checks.
# Getting banned, warned. etc is your own fault.
